###error C268:'sqrt':ambiguous call to overloaded function
I'm using Visual Studio 2010 and used int type argument for sqrt.  The reason is that there are 2 overloaded functions for sqrt, which can either take a double, or a float.

But it seems that there is sqrt(int) in standard C++ now, hopefully Visual Studio will update its cmath soon.
